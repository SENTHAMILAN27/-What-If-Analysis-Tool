# 📊 What-If Scenario Planner Tool – Excel Business Simulation

## 🔍 Project Overview
This Excel-based What-If Scenario Planner helps business users simulate the financial impact of changes in discounts, costs, and pricing strategies — without altering original datasets.

The tool empowers decision-makers to test assumptions, visualize outcomes, and make informed pricing or cost-optimization strategies for margin improvement.

## 💡 Real Business Insight Uncovered
